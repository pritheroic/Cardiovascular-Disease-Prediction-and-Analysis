# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-and-Analysis
Overview
Cardiovascular disorders are the major cause of death worldwide. Identifying the reasons and creating an effective prediction system is critical for early detection and treatment. This study uses a dataset containing significant characteristics influencing heart health to forecast the occurrence of heart attacks.
Project Description:
This study entails a thorough investigation and analysis of cardiovascular health data. Key tasks include:

Data exploration and cleaning:

Preliminary Inspection: Loaded the dataset and looked for missing values and duplicates.
Data cleaning: Removed duplicate entries and dealt with missing values correctly.
Statistical summary:

Created a statistical summary to better comprehend the data's core patterns and distribution.
Categorical variables were identified for further study.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA):

Examined the distribution of CVD across numerous factors:
Age: Visualized age distribution by CVD status.
Gender: Examined gender distribution by CVD status.
Resting Blood Pressure: Investigated the relationship between resting blood pressure and CVD.
Cholesterol Levels: Analyzed cholesterol levels in relation to CVD.
Peak Exercise: Studied the impact of maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
Thalassemia: Explored the occurrence of thalassemia in CVD patients.
Visualizations:
To help the analysis, I created visualizations such as histograms, count plots, and box plots.
Baseline Model:
I created a Logistic Regression model to predict the occurrence of a heart attack.
The model's performance was evaluated using classification measures.
